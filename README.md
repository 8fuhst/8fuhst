## Moin!
I'm Noah from Hamburg, Germany. I mostly like to code in Python, specifically on Machine Learning Projects and Bots.
I'm currently in my Master's at the University of Hamburg.

ðŸ’» Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, LaTeX, ...

ðŸ“š Libraries: PyTorch, Numpy, MPL, Vue.js, Spring Boot, ...

ðŸ’¾ Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, ...

When coding, I like to look for creative solutions and feature ideas. For me, first building an MVP software and then iteratively adding features to it is a very fun and creative process. I feel it is very rewarding to see a software that started out as a little project grow and evolve naturally into a tool that can help deal with real-world problems - rather than to have a full-fledged program definition from the start.
